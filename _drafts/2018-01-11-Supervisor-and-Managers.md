Lately, I've been doing a fair amount of hiring, but not of Engineers. Year-End promotions have left a few vaccuums in our organization including peer management positions and as a result we're opening several positions to backfill managers and also open up positions for Supervisors as our teams and number of reports grow.  The most recent change has spiked my number of Engineers up to 32. I wholly unsustainable number. As a result, I've been putting a lot of thought into what it takes to hire for and be a good Engineering Supervisor.

When it came to posting for an Engineering Manager, I was unsurprised to find we didn't have an existing position posting or description of the Job so I dove in to defining the differentiators between Managers and Supervisors. My research through peer conversations in the office and through my network of Engineering Managers on eng-managers.slack.com, I came up with the following high-level list:

- Roles and Responsibilities
	- Managers
		- Organizational scope of work
		- Strategy Alignment
		- External Focus to the Unit
		- What to do
		- Removed from the daily work
		- Comp, hire, fire, deicsions
	- Supervisors
		- Single Team scope of work
		- Tactical Alignment
		- Internal focus on individuals
		- How to do it
		- Do the daily work
		- Comp, hire, fire input
		
As you can see, much of this list is about scope. With supervisors being focused on a single unit, a small group of Engineers, and being a part of the daily work, they operate in a hybrid space of Engineering and Management. From my perspective as a Manager, the Supervisor can do a lot to provide focused feedback, coaching, and mentoring to a team on delivering value.

This balance of Engineering and Management makes for a great space to see individuals considering a path in Management. Often Engineers hate the idea of pulling away from the technology and dealing with "people" issues. Higher-levels or Engineering or Architecture can be seen as the only path up for someone in an Engineering position. But for someone with the potential or the interest, this is a way to dip toes into the pool and try out the waters before diving into the deep end.

It becomes a new kind of talent pipeline. Not one to fill the next Engineer opening that you have under you, but to fill the next opening you have next to you. It is the closest you can get to picking who you work with in my opinion.
