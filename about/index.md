# <center>Who I am</center>

<center>I love EDM music. I have 3 cats, Milton, Winston, and Ivan. I don't like IPA's. I watch more video games than I play. I'm obsessed with Home Automation and 3D Printing.</center>

# <center>What I do</center>

<center>Engineering Management. I believe leading is about the example you set and not the words you say. I champion people and culture for IT organizations.</center>

# <center>Where I'm from</center>

<center>The midwest. I currently reside in Minneapolis, by way of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Ohio.</center>
